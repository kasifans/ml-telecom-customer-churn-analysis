Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

Author: Mohammad Kasif Ansari
Project Type: DIY Machine Learning Project
 Goal: Predict whether a telecom customer will churn (leave) or stay using Machine Learning.

 Overview

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges in the telecom industry. Losing customers increases revenue loss and forces higher marketing spending to acquire new ones.

This project uses machine learning to:

Identify customers most likely to churn

 Understand factors leading to churn (e.g., contract type, monthly charges, tenure)

 Support telecom companies in making data-driven retention decisions

  Machine Learning Approach

Two models were trained and evaluated:

Model	Status	Notes
Logistic Regression	Baseline Model	Simple & interpretable
Random Forest Classifier	Best Model ✔	Highest accuracy, good feature insights

Final chosen model: Random Forest

 Results Summary
Metric	Value
Best Accuracy	~84.65%
Customers Churned	~26.5%
Customers Retained	~73.5%
Key Insights

Customers with low tenure are more likely to churn.

Higher monthly charges correlate with churn risk.

Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate.

Services like fiber optic and paperless billing show higher churn tendency.
